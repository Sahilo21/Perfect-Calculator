# Perfect-Calculator

I know it’s a small step, but for me, it’s the beginning of my journey as a developer. 
Through this project, I practiced:
 Writing clean and structured code
 Handling basic user interactions
 Strengthening my problem-solving skills

It may look simple, but behind it is hours of hard work, learning, and consistency. This project marks the start of building more complex applications and sharpening my full stack skills. �

I believe every big achievement begins with small steps, and this is mine.
